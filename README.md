###Compiling Code
  + Code can be compiled from the RestaurantGui.java file.  Clicking Run in Eclipse while in RestaurantGui.java should 
  + launch the restaurant similution without any errors.  All requirements were, to the best of my knowledge, met.

###GuiInstructions
  + The text field is where the name for any customer and/or waiter is input.  
  + Customers are added by clicking the "Add Customer" button, at which point the current text in the text field 
  + becomes the new customer's name and his/her initial hunger status is determined by the state of the "Hungry?" 
  + checkbox next to the "Add Customer" button: selected to start hungry and unselected to start not hungry.
  + Waiters are added by clicking the "Add Waiter" button, at which point the current text in the text field 
  + becomes the new waiter's name.
  + The "Pause" button pauses the actions of each agent after they have completed their current action, but before they 
  + attempt to select another action.  After the "Pause" button is pressed it is replaced by a "Resume" button in the 
  + same location.  Pressing the "Resume" button resumes normal agent action and replaces the "Resume" button with the
  + "Pause" button once more.
